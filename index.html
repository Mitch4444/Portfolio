        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Mitchell. I'm a Web Developer based in Arizona with a hunger for learning new things. 

            Currently, I am a student at the Full Stack Flex program at Thinkful. Figuring out how to overcome obstacles in coding is 
            satisfying for me because I love to see how things work and how each program can be written in different ways. I am more 
            comfortable and experienced with the front-end of web development, however, I am excited to learn more about the back-end 
            and get more hands-on experience to better understand it.
            
            On an average day, I enjoy sharpening my coding skills, playing video games, being outdoors, playing sports, and being with
            my Fiance and puppy. I have the determination to see things through to their final product and I am always willing to learn
            more.</p>
